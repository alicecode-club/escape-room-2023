        <h1>Greetings, bold warriors, to your last task
        At the School of Good and Evil, where heroes are made
        Where villains are born and legends are written
        King Arthur and Cinderella, well-worn stories </h1>
        
        <h1>But yesterday the legend about Sophie and Agatha  was stolen away, we must save them today
        To find it again, we must delve deep
        Old documents and letters we must seek </h1>
        
        <h1>Puzzles to solve, mysteries to unravel
        In the forest of legends, we must travel
        Our heroes must be brave, our mission is grand
        To bring back the legend, the fate of the land </h1>
